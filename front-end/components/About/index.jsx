      <p>
        Passionate and self-driven MERN stack developer. I recently graduated in
        Diploma in Computer Engineering and have immersed myself in web
        development, focusing on building full-stack applications using the
        powerful MERN stack. I love creating dynamic, user-friendly websites and
        web applications, and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills.
        Iâ€™ve worked on several personal projects where I built everything from
        the front-end with React to the back-end with Node.js and MongoDB. This
        hands-on experience has given me a deep understanding of building
        scalable and efficient web applications.
